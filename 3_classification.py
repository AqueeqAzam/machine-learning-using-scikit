 Classification is a very common problems in the real world. For example,
 we want to classify some products into good and bad quality, emails into good or junk,
 books into interesting or boring, and so on. As discussed before, two key factors make
 a problem into a classification problem, (1) the problem has correct answer (labels),
  and (2) the output we want is categorical data, such as Yes or No, or different categories
  Types of classification
  linear model -> logistic regression, support vector machine
  Non-linear models-> k-nearest, kerne--l, Naive bayes, Decision tree, Random forest


# Datasets -> A data set is a collection of numbers or values that relate to a particular subject.
# The number of fish eaten by each dolphin at an aquarium is a data set.
# label -> In Machine Learning feature means property of your training data.
# feature -> The output you get from your model after training it is called a label.
# f(feature) -> label, f(input) -> output, f(data) -> target
# predict gender as Male or Female, f(age, height, body_type) = f(22, 5.3, soft) -> femail
